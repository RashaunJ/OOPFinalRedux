=============

Photosnap is an application that allows you to upload any image from your computer and then apply a filter and border to that picture which then can be saved on your computer.

User Manual
The first thing to do when the program starts is click File>Open 
The photo you choose to upload will then pop up in a  new window
After your image is loaded, you click the Filters button which then presents you with the options: Sepia, Grayscale, Invert, Saturate High and Saturate Low
Once you pick a filter, that filter is immediately applied to the image
The cool thing about our app is that you can stack filters on top of each other to get even cooler looking pictures
After you’re done fooling around with the awesome filters, you can choose to apply a border by clicking the Border button
Once you are all finished applying effects to your picture, you can save it by clicking File>Save which then saves your edited photo on your desktop
If you want to post the image to twitter, you can do that by clicking Online>Post to Twitter
If you don’t have any more photos to edit, you can click File>Quit to quit out of the app
